### -- SNAKE TS --

This is a small project, the main goal is to implement different kinds of 'Snake-like' games, and to learn how to use
some npm libraries in the process.

As of now, there's only one "game": Road-Jump Snake

#### Road-Jump Snake

Will you be able to collect every fruit before getting off-road?
Put your skills to the test and show 'em who's the __BIGGEST__ Snake of all.

#### Classic-Snake Snake

Does this one need an explanation?
