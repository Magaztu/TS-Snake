### Classic Snake!

This is the game you know and love, classic - snake!, where you take control over a cute _-blocky-_ snake and try to eat as much fruits as you can before bumping into yourself or the walls... Watch out! as the snake grows one tile for every fruit eaten.



To control the snake, just use the arrow keys or WASD. Try to avoid the walls and your -ever growing- body!
    Growing body?! YEaH! Eat fruits (`Â¬`) to grow bigger, and also score higher!



If you're still reading... I might've lied... This variant of the 'snake-game' does **not** move the snake forward automatically.


So take your time thinking about your next move! ~~I might add another variant with said auto-movement... or scrolling if that word is correct lol~~

Have fun!
